# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core MVP

**Goal:** Implement basic OAuth2 token management with file storage
**Success Criteria:** Successfully authenticate and refresh tokens for single account

### Features

- [ ] Basic OAuth2 authorization code flow implementation - Exchange authorization code for tokens `M`
- [ ] Token storage in JSON file - Save and load tokens from local filesystem `S`
- [ ] Token expiration tracking - Calculate and check token validity `S`
- [ ] Manual token refresh - Refresh expired tokens on demand `S`
- [ ] Basic error handling - Handle common OAuth errors gracefully `S`

### Dependencies

- Access to Amazon Advertising API credentials

## Phase 2: Advanced Token Management

**Goal:** Add automatic refresh and thread safety
**Success Criteria:** Zero downtime from token expiration in production use

### Features

- [ ] Automatic token refresh - Proactively refresh before expiration `M`
- [ ] Thread-safe token operations - Add locking for concurrent access `M`
- [ ] Configurable refresh buffer - Allow customization of refresh timing `S`
- [ ] Retry logic for failures - Implement exponential backoff `S`
- [ ] Comprehensive logging - Add debug and audit logging `S`

### Dependencies

- Phase 1 completion
