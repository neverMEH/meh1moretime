# Product Mission (Lite)

Amazon Ads API Token Manager is a Python library that helps developers securely manage OAuth2 authentication for Amazon Advertising API by providing automatic token refresh, secure storage, and thread-safe token management.

This library serves Python developers building Amazon Advertising integrations who need reliable authentication without manual token management. Unlike basic OAuth implementations, it proactively refreshes tokens before expiration, ensuring zero-downtime API operations while maintaining secure credential storage and thread-safe concurrent access.
