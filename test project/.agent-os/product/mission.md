# Product Mission

## Pitch

Amazon Ads API Token Manager is a Python library that helps developers securely manage OAuth2 authentication for Amazon Advertising API by providing automatic token refresh, secure storage, and thread-safe token management.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **E-commerce Agencies:** Digital marketing agencies managing Amazon advertising campaigns for multiple clients
- **SaaS Developers:** Companies building Amazon advertising automation and optimization tools
- **Enterprise Retailers:** Large brands managing their own Amazon advertising campaigns at scale

### User Personas

**Agency Developer** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Senior Backend Developer at Digital Marketing Agency
- **Context:** Building internal tools to manage advertising campaigns for 50+ Amazon seller clients
- **Pain Points:** Manual token management across multiple accounts, token expiration during batch operations
- **Goals:** Automate token refresh, ensure zero downtime for API operations

**SaaS Engineer** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Platform Engineer at Advertising Optimization Startup
- **Context:** Developing multi-tenant SaaS platform for Amazon advertisers
- **Pain Points:** Complex OAuth flow implementation, secure credential storage at scale
- **Goals:** Reliable authentication layer, compliance with security standards

## The Problem

### Token Expiration Disrupts Operations

Amazon Advertising API access tokens expire after 1 hour, causing API calls to fail mid-operation. This results in incomplete campaign updates and data synchronization failures affecting thousands of dollars in ad spend.

**Our Solution:** Automatic token refresh with configurable buffer time before expiration.

### Insecure Credential Storage

Many developers store refresh tokens and credentials in plain text configuration files. This creates significant security vulnerabilities with potential for unauthorized API access and account compromise.

**Our Solution:** Encrypted local storage with OS-level security integration.

### Complex OAuth Implementation

The OAuth2 authorization code flow requires multiple steps and error-prone manual implementation. Developers spend days implementing authentication instead of focusing on business logic.

**Our Solution:** Simple, well-documented API that handles the entire OAuth flow transparently.

## Differentiators

### Zero-Downtime Token Management

Unlike manual token refresh approaches, we proactively refresh tokens before expiration with configurable buffer times. This results in 100% API availability without authentication-related failures.

### Thread-Safe Concurrent Access

While basic implementations fail under concurrent load, our library provides thread-safe token management with proper locking mechanisms. This enables reliable performance for high-throughput applications processing thousands of API requests simultaneously.
